This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in VHDL: uninitialized signals within processes.  The code in `bug.vhdl` shows a signal declared but not given an initial value, resulting in unpredictable output.  `bugSolution.vhdl` provides a corrected version with proper signal initialization.  Understanding signal initialization is crucial for reliable and predictable VHDL designs.
